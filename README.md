# Final-Project-DataEngineering

## Tweets Analyser website
### Made by Radu Cernaianu, Cl√©ment Lambling and Louis Potron.

## Model:

We built our model using the given dataset on Donald Trump's Tweets.

After some testing and comparing we went with a gensim model.

## Web Interface:

We built a basic web interface where the user can enter the word or sentence needed to be analysed. The result will be a list of 20 tweets related to it.

## Automation:

We used Jenkins to test, automate and build the application.

## Monitoring:

We used Prometheus to monitor some hardware and software metrics and Grafana for the dashboard.
